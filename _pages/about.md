Dr. Zhang joined [Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia](https://www.hli.ubc.ca/) in 2019 as an associate member. His primary appointment is at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/), where he was recruited in 2017 as an assistant professor & Canada Research Chair in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (tier 2). Before that, Dr. Zhang has worked as a Ph.D. statistician at [Eli Lilly & Co.](https://www.lilly.com/)  and [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) (2014-2017).

Area of Interest
======
Dr. Zhang’s research focus is to develop and apply novel biostatistics methods and software tools to solve real-world problems in medicine research. His research interests include: (1) Bioinformatics, (2) Biostatistics, (3) Machine learning, (4) Design of clinical trials, (5) Big data problems in any field


Openings
======
**Postdoc fellowship** I could hire regular postdoc using research grant, but the salary will not be competitive. I'd like candidates to apply additional funding from other agencies, such as [PIMS postdoc](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral), [CANSSI postdoc](http://www.canssi.ca/research-and-training-opportunities/canssi-postdoctoral-fellowships/), [NSERC postdoc](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/PDF-BP_eng.asp) , [MITACS postdoc](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/elevate), [MITACS Early Career Fellowship for China](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/come-to-canada/early-career-fellowship-china), etc.  Successful candidates are expected to have solid statistics knowledge and strong programming skills. Background in machine learning and/or bioinformatics are preferred. 

**PhD/MSc students** Department will provide about $5000/year TA salary for all graduate students. My students are encouraged to apply [VADA scholarship](http://vada.cs.umanitoba.ca/admissions/application-form/)  or  [this link](http://www.math.uvic.ca/~xuekui/files/VADA.pdf). Research Assistant positions are available for students with strong research ability and motivation. 
[UVic tuition ](https://www.uvic.ca/vpfo/accounting/assets/docs/tuition/tuition-schedule.pdf) is about $2000 per term, which is much lower than most other universities in Canada.
