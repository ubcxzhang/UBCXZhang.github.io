Openings
======
**Postdoc fellowship** I could hire regular postdoc using research grant, but the salary will not be competitive. I'd like candidates to apply additional funding from other agencies, such as [PIMS postdoc](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral), [CANSSI postdoc](http://www.canssi.ca/research-and-training-opportunities/canssi-postdoctoral-fellowships/), [NSERC postdoc](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/PDF-BP_eng.asp) , [MITACS postdoc](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/elevate), [MITACS Early Career Fellowship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/come-to-canada/early-career-fellowship-china), etc.  Successful candidates are expected to have solid statistics knowledge and strong programming skills. Background in machine learning and/or bioinformatics are preferred. </p>

**PhD/MSc students** Department will provide about $5000/year TA salary for all graduate students.
